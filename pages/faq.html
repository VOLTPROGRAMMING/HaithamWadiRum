                There are several options to spend a night in the desert of Wadi Rum. The traditional way would be sleeping in a Bedouin camp. There are many Bedouin camps in Wadi Rum with different locations. Our ones is about 13 km away from the village at a very nice and safe place very close to the famous Lawrence House. You can find everything about our camp here. Another way to explore the night in the desert would be sleeping in our private cave. It’s a cozy and wind protected place. No building. No noise. Just the desert and you. The perfect ecotourism experience

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                We recommend protection for your head and plenty of sunscreen. You will also need a bag or backpack for daytime activities where you store your camera, water, head covering, snacks and perhaps a light sweater or something with long sleeves. We provide all the water you need. Please don’t forget to bring a towel.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                Clothes: You can wear almost anything that will let you sit on the ground, ride a camel or scramble into a jeep. We do ask ladies not to wear anything too skimpy when they are in the village (halter necks, short shorts, etc). When you are out in the desert then it doesn’t matter because we are used to just about anything! But please do keep a tee shirt available for the village.
                Shoes: Unless you are doing a heavy scrambling program, you do not need boots for the hiking programs. Trainers or good walking shoes, even sneakers are fine. Socks are a good idea, though. Trekking sandals are very good, especially in warm/hot weather. The models with closed toes are best.
                Sleeping equipment: We supply mattresses, blankets and pillows. In cold weather we have comforters which keep you nice and warm. There is no real need for you to bring sleeping bags, but some people prefer to use their own. This is up to you. In the winter, we move the fire and supper inside one of the tents and snuggle up with blankets for after supper talk. You should not be cold at night, but in the evenings in the winter you do need sweater and/or jacket.

                You can bring it out to the camp and store it in your own tent. Some people prefer to sort out what they need into a smaller bag or bags and leave the main luggage in our office in Wadi Rum village where it will be safe. Don’t forget to bring your own towel.

                There is a health centre in Wadi Rum where a qualified doctor is always on duty. He can deal with the most usual problems and accidents. If necessary he will send you to Aqaba in an ambulance or a taxi – or even a helicopter if he thinks urgent treatment is needed. There is anti toxin here against snakes and scorpions but the chance to meet one of these nasty creatures is very low.

              <p>
                Unfortunately we don’t have ATMs or banks in the village and we are not able to take credit cards. Therefore we have to ask for payment in cash. There are ATMs in bigger cities like Aqaba, Wadi Musa (Petra), Madaba and Amman.

                All of my guides speak fluent English but none of the guides currently working in Wadi Rum speaks more than a few words of any other language. French, German, Italian, Spanish or other speakers have to manage as best they can.

                No problem. We offer a variety of dishes, based on local ones, ample in quantity and well cooked.  In warm weather, lunch is usually a salad dish, supper is always hot. Vegetarian food can be supplied, but please tell us about this or about any allergies before we go to the desert. Breakfast is bread or buns which we can warm on the fire and a choice of cheese, eggs etc.  (whatever we see in the shops that looks good).

              <p>
                Yes. The price would be the same as an ordinary tour and overnight but you should be here by 6 pm at the very latest or it will be too late to have supper in the desert.

                Here is the location of the meeting point. It’s Ahmed’s house in the center of the village. You’ll see a board on the wall. You can park your car safely there.

              <p>
                The guides are paid by the day and not by the hour. They would therefore be expecting a payment for two days. This is fair enough since they are blocked for the day in this case and cannot accept another contract. We don’t charge you the full two days, this comes from our pocket but we do charge you extra.

              <p>
                Usually this is possible with a 50 JOD extra. However, the supply of good guides is not unlimited and during the high season to send out too many private tours means that a lot of people could not get a tour at all. There are 8 people max. sharing the tour (jeep capacity).

                Our prices are on the basis of a minimum of 2 persons per tour. If you are traveling alone the price for just one person would be higher. Just send us an inquiry and we will see what we can do for you. If possible we would try to put you to another tour to reduce the price per person.
